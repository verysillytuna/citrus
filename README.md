# Citrus

Welcome to the github documentation of Citrus, a thrust vector control (tvc) model rocket. Citrus is largely involved with student experimentalists at Santa Monica College and the Aerospace Club at SMC.

The purpose of this forum is to keep track of thoughts and document the protyping processes.

Citrus has 3 main goals:
- To reach a target altitude of about 10m
- To follow a vertical flight trajectory enabled by thrust vector control
- To succesfully land without damaging components

It is important to note that this project, Citrus, is inspired by work performed by SpaceX, BlueOrigin, BPS.Space's, etc., but does not intend to simply copy their work. Citrus attempts to further knowledge in rocketry in both the real and model scale. 

I, Payton Suh, will be regularly posting my consistent efforts and findings related to this project on this github repository. I thank you for reading this README, and I invite you to learn from my work just as I have from others throughout the course of possibly the next few years.
